TACOS is an acronym for Text And Characters On Screen. It is a simple retro themed text editor styled to look like computer terminals of days gone by. TACOS is a GTK application built in [Rust}(https://www.rust-lang.org/) using [gtk-rs](https://gtk-rs.org/). TACOS is still very early early in its development and is a learning process for me.

### Requirements

You need to have GTK installed on your system and the toolchain should be `stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`.

If you're having trouble, try these resources:

* [Gtk-rs Requirements / MSYS2](http://gtk-rs.org/docs/requirements.html)

* [Working with Rust on Windows](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/blob/master/README.md#working-with-rust-on-windows)


### Using

* `git clone` this repository or fork it and clone your copy.

* `cd` into the folder you cloned the project to

* run `cargo build`

* run `./target/debug/tacos.exe` (On Windows)
